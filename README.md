# MakeJarDemo3
生成依赖包测试


Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

    gradle
    maven
    sbt
    leiningen

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
Copy

Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.Mubly:MakeJarDemo3:1.0'
	}
Copy

Share this release:

That's it! The first time you request a project JitPack checks out the code, builds it and serves the build artifacts.

If the project doesn't have any GitHub Releases you can use the short commit hash or 'anyBranch-SNAPSHOT' as the version.
